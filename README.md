# Use Case
As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize accounts from a Salesforce Org to another Salesforce Org and a Database.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts from a Salesforce instance to many destination systems, using the Publish-subscribe pattern. Every time there is new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as example, but also to establish a starting point to adapt the integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Process and On Complete stages.

The integration can be triggered in two different ways: by a scheduler defined in the endpoints file or by an outbound notification generated by Salesforce. Either way, the application queries/receives newest Salesforce updates/creations matching a filter criteria and adds them to a JMS topic.

The application has two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name. The last step of the *Process* stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

# Considerations

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

## DB Considerations

To get this template to work:

This template may use date time or timestamp fields from the database to do comparisons and take further actions.
While the template handles the time zone by sending all such fields in a neutral time zone, it cannot handle time offsets.
We define time offsets as the time difference that may surface between date time and timestamp fields from different systems due to a differences in the system's internal clock.
Take this in consideration and take the actions needed to avoid the time offset.


### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using a database as a data destination.

## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work.

### FAQ

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.









# Run it!
Simple steps to get Salesforce to Salesforce and Database Account Broadcast running.
See below.

## Running On Premises
In this section we detail the way you have to run you Anypoint Temple on you computer.

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. The application will poll Account to know if there are any newly created or updated objects and synchronize them.


### Where to Download Anypoint Studio and the Mule Runtime
If you are a newcomer to Mule, here is where to get the tools.

+ [Download Anypoint Studio](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio)
+ [Download Mule runtime](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise)


### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your
Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click **Open**.


### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`
+ Click `Run`


### Running on Mule Standalone
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties and run your app with the corresponding environment variable. To follow the example, this is `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time an account is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronized to Salesforce Org B and the Database as long as it matches the filtering criteria.


### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub
Studio provides an easy way to deploy your template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so check this


## Properties to Configure
To use this template, configure properties (credentials, configurations, etc.) in the properties file or in CloudHub from Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties. The sections that follow list example values.
### Application Configuration
**HTTP Connector configuration**
+ http.port `9090`

**Batch Aggregator configuration**
+ page.size `200`

**Scheduler configuration**
+ scheduler.frequency `10000`
+ scheduler.startDelay `100`

**Watermarking default last query timestamp e.g. 2016-12-13T03:00:59Z**
+ watermark.default.expression `YESTERDAY`

**Trigger policy(push, poll)**
+ trigger.policy `push` | `poll`


**Note**: the property `trigger.policy` can asume only one of the values above either *push* or *poll*

** JMS Connector configuration **

+ jms.username `admin`
+ jms.password `admin`
+ jms.url `tcp://localhost:61616`

**Database Connector configuration**

+ db.host `localhost`
+ db.port `3306`
+ db.user `user-name1`
+ db.password `user-password1`
+ db.databasename `dbname1`

If it is required to connect to a different Database there should be provided the jar for the library and changed the value of that field in the connector.

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company A**

+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company B**

+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`

# API Calls
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / ${page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***${page.size}*** is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).


# Customize It!
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template.

More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml


## config.xml
Configuration for connectors and configuration properties are set in this file. Even change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified are in properties file, which is the recommended place to make your changes. However if you want to do core changes to the logic, you need to modify this file.

In the Studio visual editor, the properties are on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. Firstly the Template will query Salesforce for all the existing Accounts that match the filtering criteria.
2. During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name.
3. The last step of the *Process* stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.
4. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Template will log output statistics data into the console.



## endpoints.xml
This file is conformed by three Flows.

The first one we'll call it **push** flow. This one contains an HTTP endpoint that will be listening for Saleforce's outbound messages. Each of them will be processed and thus update/create Accounts, and then executing the batch job process.

The second one we'll call it **scheduler** flow. This one contains the Scheduler endpoint that will periodically trigger **sfdcQuery** flow and then executing the batch job process.

The third one we'll call it **sfdcQuery** flow. This one contains watermarking logic that will be querying Salesforce for updated/created Accounts that meet the defined criteria in the query since the last polling. The last invocation timestamp is stored by using Objectstore Component and updated after each Salesforce query.

The property **trigger.policy** is the one in charge of defining from which endpoint the Template will receive the data. When the push policy is selected, the http inbound connector is used for Salesforce's outbound messaging and polling mechanism is ignored. The property can only assume one of two values `push` or `poll` any other value will result in the Template ignoring all messages.



## errorHandling.xml
This is the right place to handle how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. 
This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
