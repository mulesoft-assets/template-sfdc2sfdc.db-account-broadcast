As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize accounts from a Salesforce Org to another Salesforce Org and a Database.

This Anypoint template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts from a Salesforce instance to many destination systems, using the Publish-subscribe pattern. Every time there is new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as example, but also to establish a starting point to adapt the integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module.
The batch job is divided in Process and On Complete stages.

The integration can be triggered in two different ways: by a scheduler defined in the endpoints file or by an outbound notification generated by Salesforce. Either way, the application queries/receives newest Salesforce updates/creations matching a filter criteria and adds them to a JMS topic.

The application has two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name. The last step of the *Process* stage groups the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs output statistics data into the console.

To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made for the template to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

In this section we detail the way you have to run you Anypoint Temple on you computer.

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. The application will poll Account to know if there are any newly created or updated objects and synchronize them.

		<section id="default_running_on_cloudhub">

While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment &gt; Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time an account is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronized to Salesforce Org B and the Database as long as it matches the filtering criteria.

**HTTP Connector Configuration**
+ http.port `9090`

**Batch Aggregator Configuration**
+ page.size `200`

**Scheduler Configuration**
+ scheduler.frequency `10000`
+ scheduler.startDelay `100`

**Watermarking default last query timestamp e.g. 2016-12-13T03:00:59Z**
+ watermark.default.expression `YESTERDAY`

**Trigger policy(push, poll)**
+ trigger.policy `push` | `poll`


**Note**: the property `trigger.policy` can asume only one of the values above either *push* or *poll*

** JMS Connector configuration **

+ jms.username `admin`
+ jms.password `admin`
+ jms.url `tcp://localhost:61616`

**Database Connector Configuration**

+ db.host `localhost`
+ db.port `3306`
+ db.user `user-name1`
+ db.password `user-password1`
+ db.databasename `dbname1`

If it is required to connect to a different Database there should be provided the jar for the library and changed the value of that field in the connector.

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company A**

+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company B**

+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`

		<section id="api_calls">
		
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / ${page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***${page.size}*** is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

Functional aspect of the template is implemented on this XML, directed by two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this template:

1. Firstly the Template queries Salesforce for all the existing Accounts that match the filtering criteria.
2. During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name.
3. The last step of the *Process* stage groups the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.
4. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Template logs output statistics data into the console.

This file is conformed by three Flows.

The first one we'll call it **push** flow. This one contains an HTTP endpoint that will be listening for Saleforce's outbound messages. Each of them will be processed and thus update/create Accounts, and then executing the batch job process.

The second one we'll call it **scheduler** flow. This one contains the Scheduler endpoint that will periodically trigger **sfdcQuery** flow and then executing the batch job process.

The third one we'll call it **sfdcQuery** flow. This one contains watermarking logic that will be querying Salesforce for updated/created Accounts that meet the defined criteria in the query since the last polling. The last invocation timestamp is stored by using Objectstore Component and updated after each Salesforce query.

The property **trigger.policy** is the one in charge of defining from which endpoint the Template will receive the data. When the push policy is selected, the http inbound connector is used for Salesforce's outbound messaging and polling mechanism is ignored. The property can only assume one of two values `push` or `poll` any other value will result in the Template ignoring all messages.
